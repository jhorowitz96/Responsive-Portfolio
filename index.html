                        <p>My name is Jason Horowitz. I currently work at Hobsons, Inc. as an Advanced Product
                            Specialist, and the specific product I work with is called Starfish. This is a platform
                            that helps students stay in touch with their Instructors and Advisors at Higher Ed
                            Institutions and keeps them on track to graduate.</p>

                        <p>I went to the University of Rhode Island and graduated with a degree in marketing in 2009.
                            After school I lived in Conshohocken for a few years and then lived in Maryland and DC for
                            5 before moving back to Philly last August where I work remotely for Hobsons.</p>

                        <p>In my spare time I love watching and playing sports, specifically pick up basketball. I also
                            enjoy going to the dog park with my wife, Becca, and my dog, Greeley. Hopefully Iâ€™ll also
                            enjoy coding in my spare time! I also love listening to music while I'm working and talk
                            radio when I'm not. Hopefully my next assignments look better than this one :)</p>
